# SupervisedLearningProject
For this project 'Heart Disease' data from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository has been used.
Link for the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
The dataset has 303 samples and 13 features. 
There are 7 categorical features and 6 numerical features. 
The target variable is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. 
For the purpose of this project we need to predict if a person has heart disease or not 
so we will use 0 to indicate the absence of heart disease and 1 to indicate the presence of heart disease.
